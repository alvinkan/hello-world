"And that’s a wrap #TalentConnect.  

It was so exciting to see LinkedIn Talent Insights featured on the main stage and I’m thrilled to have contributed to the insights showcased in our inLounge area. Talent Connect was truly #PoweredByInsights

Until next year!"
"Talent Connect 2018 is a wrap! 

With main stage announcements about Talent Insights and diversity data, InLounge installations exploring global labor market trends, and half a dozen breakout sessions showcasing the power of talent intelligence, it’s abundantly clear: Talent Connect 2018 was #PoweredByInsights

Thank you to every member of the global Insights team who rallied to make this the most data-driven (read: best) TC in history. You raise the bar every day.

See you next year in Dallas, TX!"
"Last year at Talent Connect, LinkedIn unveiled our plans to develop the Talent Insights Product. 

This year, several customers including Lamar Mills from Workday, Craig Vived and Jenny Diani from Autodesk, Matt Brandt from Morgan Stanley, many people from Chuck Edward’s world and beyond at Microsoft and LinkedIn’s own head of people analytics David White told their stories about the impact that Talent Insights is already driving for their business - and for their own careers. 

Real-time talent data enables better and faster decisions. It is also changing the way decisions get made and the way organizations operate by making talent strategy a team sport. 

Thrilled for the journey ahead!
